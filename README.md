## Part 1: Git

### 1.1. List the contents of the lab03-exercises repo immediately after initialization

### 1.6. Reflection

We've learned 6 git subcommands now. Describe each of them in your own words in the section below:

- git init       This is how you add Git to your project.
- git status     It lets you see the current state of your files.
- git add         This  is how you start tracking individual files.
- git commit      It creates a new commit.
- git log          It displays the commit history of your repository.
- git diff          It shows the differences between various states of your repository.

### 1.7. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Java)

Make sure you implement the `FindDuplicates.java` class as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).

## Part 2: GitHub

### 2.1. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Python)

Make sure you implement the `find_duplicates.py` file as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).

## Part 3: Branching

### 3.1. Implement the More Efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem

Implement the more efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem using a dictionary (or hashmap) data structure instead of nested loops. You may do this in either your Python file or in the Java file that youâ€™ve already made. Do this by adding a second function/method to your Java/Python file with a slightly different name.

### 3.2. Link to Repo

Please make sure that the new repo that you made today on GitHub is public, and paste a link to it below.

```bash
https://github.com/Hayden514/lab03-exercise

### 3.3. What do the three "Merge pull request" options mean?

Describe each of them in your own words.### 3.3. What do the three "Merge pull request" options mean?

1. **Create a merge commit**:  
   This option merges the feature branch into the main branch while keeping all the commits from the feature branch.  
   Git creates an extra "merge commit" to show that a merge occurred.

   - Advantage: preserves full history of the branch.
   - Disadvantage: can make the commit history more complex.

2. **Squash and merge**:  
   This option combines all commits from the feature branch into a single commit and merges it into the main branch.

   - Advantage: keeps the main branch history clean and simple.
   - Disadvantage: loses the individual commits from the feature branch.

3. **Rebase and merge**:  
   This option takes the commits from the feature branch and applies them on top of the main branch, creating a linear history without an extra merge commit.
   - Advantage: produces a linear and clean commit history.
   - Disadvantage: rewrites commit history, which may be risky if others already depend on the branch.
